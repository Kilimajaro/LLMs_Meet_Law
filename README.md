# When Large Language Models Meet Law: Research Framework, Technological Evolution, and Ethical Challenges

## Overview

This repository contains materials for the first comprehensive review of Large Language Models (LLMs) in legal domains, featuring an innovative dual taxonomy integrating legal reasoning frameworks and professional ontologies. The work systematically examines:

- Historical evolution from symbolic AI to transformer-based LLMs
- Technical breakthroughs in context scalability, knowledge integration, and evaluation rigor
- Ethical challenges including hallucination, explainability deficits, and jurisdictional adaptation
- Future research directions for next-generation legal AI systems
